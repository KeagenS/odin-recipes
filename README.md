The first project for TOP
Created a total of four html pages (home page and 3 recipe pages)
The home page as a list of all the recipes.
Each recipe page has an image of the dish, description, ingredients, steps and a link back to the home page.
The pages are styled with a green background and images and text are centered.
Images are all the same sizes.
